# Pokemoncito

This funny app fetches and displays all of the 900k pokemons that live in the http://pokeapi.co
It does so in batches of 20 of them and when the user has reached the bottom of the view, in an infinite scroll style.

## Getting Started

To run this app, you will likely need to have XCode 10.1 installed and also have cocoapods.

### Preparing

Business as usual, the only step to prepare the app so XCode can run it is done by installing the required dependencies:

```
pod install
```

When it has finished, XCode should be able to run the app
